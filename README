Building and verifying

Building the application is very easy. Just extract the application downloaded and go to the application folder (where you can see pom.xml) from command prompt, and run below maven command. First run may take a while as maven tries to download all dependencies from central repository.

mvn clean install

"Build is successful". Now let us run the application with the following command

mvn jetty:run

Hurrey. Lets see the application we built, Go to your favourite browser and access the application @
